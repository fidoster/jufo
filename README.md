# jufo-browser-plugin
Simple Chrome extension that utilized the REST API of the JUFO portal to fetch publication channel level information. 

Extension uses the highlighted text in the active tab to make an ISSN and publication channel name based search queries. Please note, that currently only the first result is shown, which might not be the right result, especially when searching with partial name or issn identifier.
