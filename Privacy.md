# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 8 January 2025**

JUFO Quick Check does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. 

All processing is performed locally within the user’s browser. The extension communicates with the JUFO REST API to fetch publicly available journal information, but no user-related data is involved in this process.

## What We Don’t Collect
- No Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  
- No authentication or login credentials  
- No financial, health, or location data  

## External APIs
The extension uses the JUFO REST API solely to retrieve publicly available data about journals. No user data is sent to or stored by this API.

## Questions?
